EXPERIENCE
Lead Computer Vision Engineer (Founding Team), Fyve By Aug 2023 – Present
• Led development of a LiDAR-based perception system for aircraft hangar safety, integrating Velodyne, RoboSense, and
Livox sensors and ZED Cameras for robust 3D spatial awareness in dynamic environments
• Built and optimized perception pipelines on edge platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi), from rapid prototyping to
production-grade deployment with Amazon S3 for low-latency, high-efficiency performance
• Designed and deployed real-time point cloud processing algorithms for object detection, tracking, denoising, and
feedback control, achieving sub-5 ms latency on large-scale data
• Applied and benchmarked SLAM algorithms (Fast-LIO, Fast-LIVO, LIO-SAM) for accurate localization and high-fidelity
environment reconstruction, reducing drift and increasing mapping accuracy to 99.8%
• Implemented sensor fusion frameworks using ROS/ROS2 (C++/Python) for multi-sensor data synchronization,
processing, and TCP-based communication with UI/front-end and Unity systems. Managed data infrastructure,
including data collection, structured storage, and cloud integration via Amazon S3, and performed data analysis
• Developing deep learning pipelines for real-time point cloud classification, researching and integrating custom models
to enhance semantic understanding of environments
• Standardized system deployments, resolved hardware-software integration issues in the field, and collaborated crossfunctionally to meet system KPIs and latency targets
Graduate Technical Intern (Machine Learning), Intel Corporation May 2022 – Dec 2022
• Created a machine learning based sandbox model for aging prediction across device families for performance analysis
• Analyzed decision boundaries using collected data and designed a custom in-house performance evaluation algorithm
with 2x more accuracy and 5x faster processing; the organization adopted the project for internal resource monitoring
• Automated real-time, reliable and efficient High-Speed Test systems, cutting testing time from days to under 5 seconds
Graduate Research Assistant, CORE Robotics Lab, GaTech Dec 2021 – May 2022
• For an autonomous Wheelchair Tennis Robot, developed a ZED Vision-based camera network for localization of the
play-area to enable ball-detection, tracking, trajectory predictions and vehicle movement
• Used Probabilistic Motion Primitives (ProMP) to sketch a movement path to enable a 7DOF Robot autonomously play
Ping-Pong with a Human. Also made use of EKF and Human Body Pose Detection to predict the ball trajectory
PROJECTS
GAN-based Image Super-Resolution Techniques Aug 2021 – Dec 2021
• Replicated the latest Super Resolution (SR) research in PyTorch using SRGAN, ESRGAN and Real-ESRGAN network
• Improvised the content, perceptual and adversarial loss functions, and observed the results of cloaking on SR networks
Study of Adversarial Attacks on Image Classification DNNs Aug 2021 – Dec 2021
• Implemented, analyzed, compared the effect of state-of-the-art adversarial attacks on popular image classification DNNs
• Visualized the difference in the attention using Grad-Cam to observe where the networks look in the pre-final layer
Sardar Patel Robotics and Automation Committee (SPRAC): Oct 2016 - April 2020
• Constructed systems and robots for various themed competitions using principles of controls and image processing
• Worked on complex robot mechanisms, sensor & motor interfacing, error cancellation and decision-making algorithms
• Designed and constructed manual as well as autonomous robots controlled by controllers or sensory feedbacks
